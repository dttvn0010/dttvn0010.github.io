# STL Viewer
Loads an external .stl 3D model from AWS S3 storage, so you don't have to host it on your app.

[view it live here](https://kaitlynhova.github.io/Three.js-STL-Viewer/)

In order to check it out on local, you need to use something like [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) to create a local server. Don't worry, you don't need the PRO version.

## Directions
1. Pull down all the code from this repo.
2. [Run a local server](https://mac.appstorm.net/reviews/internet-reviews/running-a-local-server-with-mamp/) on this repo's folder.
3. Go to localhost:8888 in any browser to view.
